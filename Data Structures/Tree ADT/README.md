# Tree - Abstract Data Type (ADT)
## What is Tree 
A tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) or data structure implementing this ADT that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children, represented as a set of linked nodes. A tree data structure can be defined recursively (locally) as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no connection is duplicated, and none points to the root. Alternatively, a tree can be defined abstractly as a whole (globally) as an ordered tree assigned to each node. Both these perspectives are helpful: while a tree can be analyzed mathematically as a whole when represented as a data structure, it is usually defined and worked with separately by node (rather than as a list of nodes and an adjacency list of edges between nodes, as one may represent a digraph, for instance). For example, looking at a tree as a whole, one can talk about "the parent node" of a given node, but in general, as a data structure, a given node only contains the list of its children but does not contain a reference to its parent (if any).

In this diagram, a simple unordered tree, the node labeled 7, has two children, labeled 2 and 6, and one parent labeled 2. The root node, at the top, has no parent.


* A tree data structure is a collection of objects or entities known as nodes linked together to represent or simulate hierarchy.
* A tree data structure is non-linear because it does not store sequentially. It is a hierarchical structure as elements in a Tree are arranged in multiple levels.
* The topmost node in the Tree data structure is known as a root node. Each node contains some data, and data can be of any type. In the above tree structure, the node includes the employee's name, so the kind of data would be a string.
* Each node contains some data and the link or reference of other nodes called children.

### Definition
*A tree is a non-linear data structure that consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy. A tree can be empty with no nodes called the null or empty tree or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and one or more subtrees.*

 
**Some basic terms used in Tree data structure.**

* **Root:** The root node is the topmost node in the tree hierarchy. In other words, the root node is the one that doesn't have any parent. In the above structure, node numbered 1 is the tree's root node. If a node is directly linked to another node, it is called a parent-child relationship.
* **Child node:** If the node is a descendant of any node, then the node is known as a child node.
* **Parent:** If the node contains any sub-node, then that node is said to be the parent of that sub-node.
* **Sibling:** The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.
* **Leaf Node:**- The node of the tree, which doesn't have any child node, is called a leaf node. A leaf node is the bottom-most node of the tree. There can be any number of leaf nodes present in a general tree. Leaf nodes can also be called external nodes.
* **Internal nodes:** A node has at least one child node known as an internal
* **Ancestor node:**- An ancestor of a node is any predecessor node on a path from the root to that node. The root node doesn't have any ancestors. In the tree shown in the above image, nodes 1, 2, and 5 are the ancestors of node 10.
* **Descendant:** The immediate successor of the given node is known as a descendant of a node. In the above figure, 10 is the descendant of node 5.

### **Properties of Tree data structure**

* **Recursive data structure:** The tree is also known as a recursive data structure. A tree can be defined as recursively because the distinguished node in a tree data structure is known as a root node. The root node of the tree contains a link to all the roots of its subtrees. The left subtree is shown in the yellow color in the below figure, and the right subtree is shown in the red color. The left subtree can be further split into subtrees shown in three different colors. Recursion means reducing something in a self-similar manner. So, this recursive property of the tree data structure is implemented in various applications.

* **Number of edges:** If there are n nodes, then there would n-1 edges. Each arrow in the structure represents the link or path. Each node, except the root node, will have atleast one incoming link known as an edge. There would be one link for the parent-child relationship.
* **Depth of node x:** The depth of node x can be defined as the length of the path from the root to the node x. One edge contributes one-unit length in the path. So, the depth of node x can also be defined as the number of edges between the root node and the node x. The root node has 0 depth.
* **Height of node x:** The height of node x can be defined as the longest path from the node x to the leaf node.
 
### Implementation of Tree

The above figure shows the representation of the tree data structure in the memory. In the above structure, the node contains three fields. The second field stores the data; the first field stores the address of the left child, and the third field stores the address of the right child.

```c
struct node  
{  
    int data;  
    struct node *left;  
    struct node *right;   
}  
```

### Applications of trees

* **Storing naturally hierarchical data:** Trees store the data in the hierarchical structureâ€”for example, the file system. The file system is stored on the disc drive. The file and folder are naturally hierarchical data and stored in the form of trees.
* **Organize data:** It organizes data for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching. For example, a binary tree has a log(N) time for searching an element.
* **Trie:** It is a special kind of tree used to store the dictionary. It is a fast and efficient way for dynamic spell checking.
* **Heap:** It is also a tree data structure implemented using arrays. It is used to implement priority queues.
* **B-Tree and B+Tree:** B-Tree and B+Tree are the tree data structures used to implement indexing in databases.
* **Routing table:** The tree data structure is also used to store the data in routing tables in the routers.

### 

* **General tree:** The general tree is one of the types of tree data structure. In the general tree, a node can have either 0 or maximum n number of nodes. There is no restriction imposed on the degree of the node (the number of nodes that a node can contain). The topmost node in a general tree is known as a root node. The children of the parent node are known as subtrees.

There can be **n** number of subtrees in a general tree. In the general tree, the subtrees are unordered as the nodes in the subtree cannot be ordered. Every non-empty tree has a downward edge, and these edges are connected to the nodes known as child nodes. The root node is labeled with level 0. The nodes that have the same parent are known as siblings.

* **Binary tree:** Here, binary name itself suggests two numbers, i.e., 0 and 1. In a binary tree, each node in a tree can have utmost two child nodes. Here, utmost means whether the node has 0 nodes, 1 node or 2 nodes.

* **AVL tree**: It is one of the types of the binary tree, or we can say that it is a variant of the binary search tree. AVL tree satisfies the property of the binary tree as well as of the binary search tree. It is a self-balancing binary search tree that was invented by Adelson Velsky Lindas. Here, self-balancing means that balancing the heights of left subtree and right subtree. This balancing is measured in terms of the balancing factor. 
    
    We can consider a tree an AVL tree if the tree obeys the binary search tree and is a balancing factor. The balancing factor can be defined as the difference between the height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree. The balancing factor's value must be either 0, -1, or 1; therefore, each node in the AVL tree should have the value of the balancing factor either as 0, -1, or 1.

* **The Red-Black tree:** that is the binary search tree. The prerequisite of the Red-Black tree is that we should know about the binary search tree. In a binary search tree, the value of the left-subtree should be less than the value of that node, and the value of the right-subtree should be greater than the value of that node. As we know that the time complexity of binary search in the average case is log2n, the best case is O(1), and the worst case is O(n).
    
    When any operation is performed on the tree, we want our tree to be balanced so that all the functions like searching, insertion, deletion, etc., take less time. All these operations will have the time complexity of log2n.
    
    The red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. AVL tree is also a height balancing binary search tree then why do we require a Red-Black tree. We do not know how many rotations would be necessary to balance the tree in the AVL tree. Still, in the Red-black tree, a maximum of 2 rotations are required to balance the tree. It contains one extra bit that represents either the red or black color of a node to ensure the balancing of the tree.
    
* **Splay tree:** The splay tree data structure is also binary search tree in which recently accessed element is placed at the root position of tree by performing some rotation operations. Here, splaying means the recently accessed node. It is a self-balancing binary search tree having no explicit balance condition like AVL tree.

    It might be a possibility that height of the splay tree is not balanced, i.e., height of both left and right subtrees may differ, but the operations in splay tree takes order of logN time where n is the number of nodes.

    Splay tree is a balanced tree but it cannot be considered as a height balanced tree because after each operation, rotation is performed which leads to a balanced tree.
    
* **Treap:** Treap data structure came from the Tree and Heap data structure. So, it comprises the properties of both Tree and Heap data structures. In Binary search tree, each node on the left subtree must be equal or less than the value of the root node and each node on the right subtree must be equal or greater than the value of the root node. In heap data structure, both right and left subtrees contain larger keys than the root; therefore, we can say that the root node contains the lowest value.

    In treap data structure, each node has both key and priority where key is derived from the Binary search tree and priority is derived from the heap data structure.

* **B-tree:** It is a balanced m-way tree where m defines the order of the tree. Till now, we read that the node contains only one key but b-tree can have more than one key, and more than 2 children. It always maintains the sorted data. In binary tree, it is possible that leaf nodes can be at different levels, but in b-tree, all the leaf nodes must be at the same level.
